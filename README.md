### Hard Stone

*What is it?*

Hard stone is any of the stone types (stone, andesite, diorite, granite) that has been surrounded
by a compressing block on all six sides. Blocks that compress stone include stone itself, dirt, 
and bedrock. Hard stone takes ten times as long to mine, unless you're using a diamond pickaxe.
Once a block of stone has been surrounded by compressing blocks, it will convert to hard stone in
about the same time as it takes for wheat to grow one stage. Likewise, hard stone will convert
back to stone after it's been un-surrounded in the same amount of time. 

*How do I deal with it?*

In the early game, you'll need to go caving for stone and for ores. Mining is just going to take
too long. In the later game, your diamond pickaxe will open up the ability to do branch mining.
